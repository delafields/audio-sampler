PS card https://flowbite.com/docs/components/card/

I’m totally constrained by the line svg. I should build the site and create the lines later.

Site, uninhibited by the lines should be:

~centered~
Jeremy Fields
Current status (like, data scientist @ bloomberg OR hacking on web3 @)
things I’ve built IRL / things I’ve built in code

<lines>

~centered~
twitter / github

Add “experience” to the bottom slashes. It’s own page

Or that goes to LinkedIn
